I am a dendrochronologist studying climate, environmental change, and forest ecosystem dynamics since the late Holocene through diverse tree-ring measurements. My research emphasizes the application of cutting-edge techniques, including process-based modeling, quantitative wood anatomy, and X-ray computed tomography. 
Keywords: dendrochronology, tree rings, forest ecosystems, dendrometers, climate variability and extremes, process-based models, quantitative wood anatomy, X-ray computed tomography.
